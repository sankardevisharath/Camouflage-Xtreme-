Camouflage Xtreme  software is capable of embedding a file in a cover
 object as well as extracting that message. The inputs are,the file to be
 hidden & a digital image as cover object. The message is encrypted using
 a user defined key & then hidden behind the cover object to produce a new
 image with the hidden message. For extracting the message, the key used
 for embedding must be entered & the reverse of embedding procedure is
 done to produce the hiden file.The message can be a text or any type of
 file and the cover image format can be JPEG or BMP.
